        <h2>Why Conserve Water?</h2>
        <p>Water is essential for life, but it's a limited resource. By conserving water, we can help protect our
            environment, reduce the strain on public water systems, and save money on our utility bills. Water
            conservation also helps ensure that future generations have access to clean and safe water.</p>

            Consequently, many locals and long-term residents who relied on the bodies of water either for income,

            <h3>Global warming and water pollution</h3>Water quality is also affected by climate change, as higher
            water temperatures and more frequent floods and droughts are projected to exacerbate many forms of water
            pollution from sediments to pathogens and pesticides <a
                href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_FoodAndWater.pdf">(IPCC)</a>.

            Climate change, population growth and increasing water scarcity will put pressure on food supply (IPCC)
            as most of the freshwater used, about 70 per cent on average, is used for agriculture (it takes between
            2000 and 5000 liters of water to produce a person’s daily food) (FAO).
            </P>
            <P>Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C would approximately halve the proportion of the
                world population expected to suffer water scarcity, although there is considerable variability
                between regions <a
                    href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_FoodAndWater.pdf">(IPCC)</a>.
            </p>
            <P>imate change has made extreme weather events such as floods and droughts more likely and more severe
                <a
                    href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_FoodAndWater.pdf">(IPCC)</a>.

                Rising global temperatures increase the moisture the atmosphere can hold, resulting in more storms
                and heavy rains, but paradoxically also more intense dry spells as more water evaporates from the
                land and global weather patterns change. <a

            </P>
            <p>Since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 per cent compared with the two previous
                decades. Most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in Asia <a
                    href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wake-looming-water-crisis-report-warns">(WMO)</a>. The
                number and duration of droughts also increased by 29 per cent over this same period. Most
                drought-related deaths occurred in Africa <a href="">(WMO)</a>.</p>
