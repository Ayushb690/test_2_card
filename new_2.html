                    <h3>Case study:Bangalore’s water crisis</h3> At one point, Bangalore was known as ‘the city of lakes
                because of the large number of water bodies that scattered the region. Even now, it is a city with more
                than a hundred lakes and a thousand water bodies. As time passed, however, most of these bodies, and
                especially the major lakes like Varthur and Bellandur, were subjected to high levels of pollution.
                <br>Bangalore’s industrial growth has contributed to water pollution. <b>Karnataka State Pollution
                    Control Board (KSPCB)</b> stated in 2021, industrial units in and around Bangalore were discharging
                    a substantial amount of untreated or partially treated effluents into water bodies, contaminating them.
                    Consequently, many locals and long-term residents who relied on the bodies of water either for income,
                sustenance, or both, suffered great economic, environmental, and medical setbacks to their way of life.
                <br>The link between <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG-6</a> and water pollution is central
                to achieving sustainable development and ensuring universal access to clean water and adequate
                sanitation for all.<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG-6</a> focuses on “ensuring availability
                and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” and encompasses several targets related to
                water quality, pollution reduction, and ecosystem protection. <br>Addressing water pollution is vital to
                achieving <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG-6</a> and broader sustainable development.
                Governments, communities, and businesses must collaborate to implement effective water pollution control
                measures, invest in wastewater treatment, promote sustainable industrial practices, and raise awareness
                about responsible water usage to safeguard water resources and achieve the targets outlined in <a
                    href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">SDG-6</a> <br>This situation will persist as long as we are
                no aware of the situation and will work towards the developmentof the city rather than just making
                things worse for our own purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Global warming and water pollution</h3>Water quality is also affected by climate change, as higher
                water temperatures and more frequent floods and droughts are projected to exacerbate many forms of water
                pollution from sediments to pathogens and pesticides <a
                    href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_FoodAndWater.pdf">(IPCC)</a>.

                    Climate change, population growth and increasing water scarcity will put pressure on food supply (IPCC)
                    as most of the freshwater used, about 70 per cent on average, is used for agriculture (it takes between
                    2000 and 5000 liters of water to produce a person’s daily food) (FAO).
                </P>
                <P>Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C would approximately halve the proportion of the
                    world population expected to suffer water scarcity, although there is considerable variability
                    between regions <a

                <P>imate change has made extreme weather events such as floods and droughts more likely and more severe

                    Rising global temperatures increase the moisture the atmosphere can hold, resulting in more storms
                    and heavy rains, but paradoxically also more intense dry spells as more water evaporates from the
                    land and global weather patterns change. <a

                <p>Since 2000, flood-related disasters have risen by 134 per cent compared with the two previous
                    decades. Most of the flood-related deaths and economic losses were recorded in Asia <a
                        href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wake-looming-water-crisis-report-warns">(WMO)</a>. The
                    number and duration of droughts also increased by 29 per cent over this same period. Most
                    drought-related deaths occurred in Africa <a href="">(WMO)</a>.</p>
